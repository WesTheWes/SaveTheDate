# Save the Date for the Edmonds wedding!

A website to allow people to RSVP to the save the date for Matt and Jill's wedding!

## How it works

Guests are divided into groups, and each group has an email address.
When the list of invitees is completed and added into the site, a bulk email is sent to all of them.
This email contains a individualized link to the site that will display the save the date and allow
the guest to fill out an rsvp form for who will be arriving at the wedding!

### Admin

Allows for the admins (AKA Matt, Jill, and their parents) to log in and add groups, send
emails to one or all groups, view how many people have replied, and how many people have accepted
their invitation.

### Save the Date

A simple, nice looking save the date. Tells people when the wedding will be, and allows them to
RSVP for themselves and their family.
